    <p>
      I just wanted to do this mini website for you to read and only you.<br>
      I wish if you could see how much I love and care about you.<br>
      I want you to be my wife and I want you by my side.<br>
      This is the weirdest gift I ever done and I'm really trying my best for you. I hope you like it.<br>
      And if you can only see how much you mean to me and how much I care about you, you are the most loved person in the world.<br>
      I don’t care if it takes 10 years to marry you. I will wait and do my best just to be with you in the end.<br>
      You don’t know how proud I am of you. The things you deal with and the things you overcome make me want to be next to you and comfort you.<br>
      You are the sweetest and most pretty girl I ever met in my life. I love you with all of my heart and I will never ever do anything bad on purpose just to hurt you.<br>
      <strong>I love you</strong>
